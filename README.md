# EasyBlocks

EasyBlocks is a visual programming IDE that I developed along with Brecht Vandevoort during our time at Hasselt University.

The user can use a drag-and-drop mechanism to combine blocks in order to form a program. This program can then be executed within the IDE. The execution of a program makes use of a canvas that can display the sprites in the project The blocks in the program can control these sprites by moving or rotating them. During execution, the user can also provide input with the keyboard and/or mouse.

##Building

* Download and install Qt
* Open the `easyblocks.pro` file in Qt Creator
* Build the project
* Run

You can also build the project without Qt Creator by running the command `qmake && make` in the `src` folder.
